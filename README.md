# TSP_Heuristics
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in the field of computer science. This project tries to solve it using various optimization techniques and algorithms, including backtracking, triangular approximation, Christofides algorithm and a meta-heuristic aproach - Simulated Annealing.
